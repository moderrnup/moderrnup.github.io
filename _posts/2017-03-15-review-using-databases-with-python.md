<h4>Coursera: Using Databases with Python</h4>

I recently took the course Using Databases with Python through Coursera taught by Charles Severance. It's a course that I highly recommend it for anyone interested in a basic understanding of SQL. Coursera offers online courses in subjects such as Computer Programming, Data Analysis, and more. The majority of the classes available on Coursera have the option of taking a course for free or a paid option. If you select the paid option you will earn a certificate of completion to post on your resume or LinkedIn profile.

The course taught by Charles Severance explains the background of SQL and how to combine SQL with the programming language Python. This is the fourth course that is part of a specialization for "Python for Everybody". It is recommended not to take courses in a specialization out of order. However in my opinion since this course is primarily focused on SQL I think it's fine to take this class to get a better understanding of SQL.

I worked with SQL in the past though a former position at a software company. My basic understanding of SQL has been self taught. With this course my understanding of SQL has greatly improved. The course uses SQLite3 as its database, which allows you to work with SQL as you practice SQL commands. This is great as you won't be concerned about wrecking data to an existing database.
