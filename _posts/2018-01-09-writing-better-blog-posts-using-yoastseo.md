As someone who is more visual, I sometimes struggle with writing blog posts. For designers and photographers, content &amp; blog posts are a valuable tool in attracting an audience to your website. One of the tools that I use in writing blog posts is a Wordpress plugin called <a href="https://yoast.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">YoastSEO</a>. This Wordpress plugin provides a great structure for writing better blog posts using YoastSEO. The <a href="https://yoast.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">YoastSEO</a> plugin functions as a checker that assist in getting more traffic from search engines like Google.


<h2>Price</h2>
The <a href="https://yoast.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">YoastSEO</a> plugin for WordPress offers a free and premium versions to feature in your website. At the time of this writing, the premium version of <a href="https://yoast.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">YoastSEO</a> cost $89 for a single license. To purchase additional licenses the rate is as follows:

<ul>
<li>1 site:  $89 - 1 license </li>
<li>2 sites: $169.10 - Buy 2 licenses</li>
<li>3 sites: $253.65 - Buy 3 licenses</li>
<li>4 sites: $338.20 - Buy 4 licenses</li>
<li>5 sites: $400.50 - Buy 5 licenses</li>
</ul>

<h2>Benefits of Using YoastSEO</h2>
The YoastSEO plugin appears as part of your WordPress "Posts" dashboard":
[caption id="attachment_1093" align="aligncenter" width="300"]<a href="https://www.moderrn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-09-at-1.41.08-PM.png"><img src="https://www.moderrn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-09-at-1.41.08-PM-300x265.png" alt="YoastSEO Plugin" width="300" height="265" class="size-medium wp-image-1093" /></a> YoastSEO Plugin[/caption]

The most noteworthy parts about this view from the dashboard are the two tabs: 

<ul>
<li>Readibility</li>
<li>Keyword</li>
</ul> 

The Readability tab provides a checker to determine how well your content is readable. This tab analyzes your post in terms of Problems, Improvements, Considerations, and the Good about your posts. For example, if your sentences exceed more than 20 words, the readability tab will be highlighted as a Problem.  

In addition to Readability, the Keyword tab provides a checker that provides feedback for your SEO. Similar to the Readability tab, the tab analyzes your SEO Keyword use in terms of Problems, Improvements, Considerations, and the Good. This tabs purpose is to make sure your SEO Keyword appears in key areas of your posts. Most notably they recommend that the Keyword appears in the title, a subheader, and in the paragraph of your post. 


<h2>What Needs Improvement</h2>
One thing I would like to see in future versions of <a href="https://yoast.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">YoastSEO</a> is live error reporting. This would be similar to how spell check works in a word processor. In both the free & premium versions of <a href="https://yoast.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">YoastSEO</a> you have to manual check the Readability & SEO tabs. I have found that having <a href="https://www.grammarly.com/?q=brand&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=brand_f1&utm_content=76996511046&utm_term=grammarly&matchtype=e&placement=&network=g&gclid=Cj0KCQiA7dHSBRDEARIsAJhAHwh-828sAa4Pge9YsFJmx-thl95DPnpHdd11HGR3Bdxx8M4k-mhdZ6gaAqP8EALw_wcB" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Grammarly</a> installed helps in terms of having an additional readability checker. But having <a href="https://yoast.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">YoastSEO</a> provide a similar function would be extremely helpful to its user base.
