While digging through some old things I came across this Computer Arts Magazine from December 2005. Computer Arts Magazine is a UK Magazine for 3D, Motion, Print and Web Designers. In 2005, Facebook and Instagram had yet to be created, Youtube was just beginning, and everyone used cell phones for phone calls. Also in this year, both laptops and digital cameras were still very new and not as affordable as they are now. To look back and compare the differences today has been very interesting. Here is some of the design gear used more than ten years ago:

<ul>
<li>Adobe Creative Suite 2: Then: $1299-$999, Now: <a href="https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">$50/mo</a>.</li>
<li>Canon Rebel XT(350D)- Then: $800, Now: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007QKN22/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0007QKN22&linkCode=as2&tag=moderrnwebsit-20&linkId=2aced0380ddad3fceb0172510771f7a4">$169</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=moderrnwebsit-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B0007QKN22" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /></li>
<li>Nikon D50- Then: $700, Now:  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009GZANC/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0009GZANC&linkCode=as2&tag=moderrnwebsit-20&linkId=05817f94cb46e0fa781a9bd838c94574">$188</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=moderrnwebsit-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B0009GZANC" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /></li>
<li>Ibook G4 12'- Then: $999, Now: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YFVSAW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000YFVSAW&linkCode=as2&tag=moderrnwebsit-20&linkId=02f828faaea85384f4f9147310f3c36f">$99</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=moderrnwebsit-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B000YFVSAW" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /></li>
<li>Power Book G4 17'- Then: $2600, Now: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007QU6TM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0007QU6TM&linkCode=as2&tag=moderrnwebsit-20&linkId=ca723c83b71cbc3bdf7d733756d5c6e4">$160</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=moderrnwebsit-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B0007QU6TM" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /></li>
</ul>

<h2>Digital Cameras</h2>
Digital cameras have probably seen the most change in the last ten years. Entry level cameras like the Canon Rebel XT and Nikon D50 were not capable of doing video. Now, video recording is expected in all cameras. Even in mobile phones, consumers want the option to be able to record video from their devices. Looking at both the D50 and Rebel XT featured in this magazine, digital cameras experienced a decreased of around 87-70%.

<h2>Laptops</h2>
Apple computers have always been very popular in the creative field. One argument has to do with some design software running faster. Another reason is that things visually render better on Apple devices. However, the apple laptops featured on this list received the greatest price decrease, falling around 90%. The tendency to upgrade laptops is usually around three to four years so this type of deprecation makes sense for these devices.

<h2>Software</h2>
In terms of Software, Adobe Creative Suite still reigns supreme for designers and creatives. In 2005, the Creative Suite was available for purchase but nowadays Adobe has since been moved to a subscription platform for its software. Final cut Express still remains as a top video editing software.  

<h2>Summary: Design Gear Used More Than Ten Years Ago</h2>
In conclusion, it is interesting to see how technology has changed in the past ten years. We truly live in a remarkable time of technology. I think one thing I've realized is how fast deprecation in technology can happen. With this deprecation in mind, I think buying used may be the best option when buying gear for your field.
