I plan on visiting London this year. Before I embark on my trip, I thought I'd look for inspiration before going. One planning tool I have been anxious to try is creating inspiration Mood Boards of places I plan to travel to. I picked up the idea to create mood boards from <a href="http://patkay.com.au" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Pat Kay</a> and <a href="http://www.itchban.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Benjamin Lee</a>. It's almost similar to creating a shot list but mostly it's to get gain inspiration. Below is my London mood board for this year. 

<h2>London Mood Board: Photo Inspriation</h2>


<h4>Alex Cornell</h4>
Alex Cornell is another photographer who I have been looking at for inspiration. His <a href="https://www.instagram.com/alexcornell/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Instagram</a> includes great photography from stunning locations.

<h4>Alixe Lay</h4>
Alixe Lay has taken some amazing images of London. I first became aware of her <a href="https://www.instagram.com/alixelay/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">instagram</a> through the Matador Networks page. However, it was her photos of Bath, Somerset that caught my attention.

<h2>Onder Turkmen</h2>
Onder Turkmen has many great gems of London and Europe in general on his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/onthere/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Instagram</a> page. In addition to photographing a great city, his creative use of reflections in his photos is inspiring.

<h2>Summary</h2>
In conclusion, creating this London mood board before traveling to a destination is exciting. In the past, I always played things by ear before taking a trip. Usually, this was because I didn't want to over think a trip. However, I have found that having a plan is extremely helpful and encouraging creatively.
