title: My Website Goals for 2018

I enjoy creating goals for myself. I think having specific, measurable goals help in measuring your achievements. Looking back at 2017, I found that I didn't write as much as I hoped for when starting my website. One of my website goals for 2018 is to write more blog posts.

<h2>Blogging Twice A Week</h2>
I found that for the year of 2017, I wrote 30 blog entries. That is close to two and a half posts a month. As I was still new to blogging, I think part of the issue had to do with not having a clear process in mind. I discussed how important research is to a freelancer in one of my recent blog <a href="https://www.moderrn.com/https://www.moderrn.com/2018/02/12/spend-time-freelancer/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">posts</a>. I think after doing some research I found great templates in establishing formats for certain types of blog posts. 

<h2>Batch Scheduling</h2>
In my view, just doing research and having templates available won't help in accomplishing my goal of writing more. I found that I need to have a scheduling plan for my blog posts. Freelance to Freedom's blog <a href="http://freelancetofreedomproject.com/work-smart-get-done-less-time/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">post</a> discussed a productivity secret I heard was using batch scheduling. This is the process of devoting a day or week to get one thing done. In my case, I want to write more blog posts so by concentrating a week to writing blog post and then scheduling those posts in advance I think will also assist in reaching my goal. 

<h2>Summary</h2>
In conclusion, my hopes are implementing this plan will help me reach my website goals for 2018. It will be great to look at the end of the year and see how productive I was regarding my blog posts.
