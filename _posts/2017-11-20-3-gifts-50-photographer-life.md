Since the Holidays are around the corner, many people are out shopping for Christmas gifts for their friends and family. Because cameras as a gift are expensive, it might be a challenge to find what to get them. But there are some great inexpensive gift ideas for them. These items may not be exciting on the surface but they are extremely useful for photographers.  Below are 3 gifts under $50 for the Photographer in your life in three categories.  

<h2>3 Gifts Under $50 for the Photographer in your Life:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Additional Batteries</li>
<li>Memory Cards</li>
<li>Travel Tripods</li>
</ul>

<h3>Additional Batteries </h3>
Because battery life varies from camera to camera you can never have enough spare batteries available. An alternative idea is to care a spare battery pack to charge all your electronic devices. However, using a spare battery pack does take time to recharge your camera battery. Having a fully charged spare battery available means less downtime for your camera. 

<h3>Memory Cards</h3>
As a photography enthusiast, I found that you can never have enough memory cards. You can keep an extra memory card in your wallet or backpack if you leave your memory card at home. The <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01J5RHD58/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01J5RHD58&linkCode=as2&tag=moderrnwebsit-20&linkId=462966c41a0a7cab89262bc858c2042f">SanDisk Extreme Pro 64GB</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=moderrnwebsit-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B01J5RHD58" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> is an affordable memory card that is very reliable.


<h3>Travel Tripods </h3>
A travel tripod makes a great gift. Travel tripods are usually small and lightweight compared to most tripods. In my opinion the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ANCPNM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000ANCPNM&linkCode=as2&tag=moderrnwebsit-20&linkId=6136e0dffc18fa0988147941a364909c">Pedco UltraPod II Lightweight Tripod</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=moderrnwebsit-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B000ANCPNM" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> makes an excellent choice. It's small, lightweight, and flexible. The Velcro strap allows the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ANCPNM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000ANCPNM&linkCode=as2&tag=moderrnwebsit-20&linkId=6136e0dffc18fa0988147941a364909c">Pedco UltraPod II Lightweight Tripod</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=moderrnwebsit-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B000ANCPNM" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> to be attached to a variety of surfaces. 

In conclusion, there are many affordable gift options to choose from for photographers. Hopefully, the above items give you a general idea of options to choose from. And if you're a photographer yourself you can treat yourself to some of the gifts above.
