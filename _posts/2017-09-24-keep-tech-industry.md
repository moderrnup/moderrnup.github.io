I recently happened upon Cameron Chapman's article on Skillcrush which detailed on how to stay current in the tech industry. The tech industry is constantly changing and can become exhausting to keep up with the ever changing trends.

2. Spend Time Reading Every Day from industry news sources.
3. Focusing on user needs rather than trends.
