I have not been to Iceland, but if I was to visit I would use Alex Cornell's Iceland Travel <a href="https://www.alexcornell.com/iceland-travel-guide/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Guide</a>. In the last several years, Iceland has been a hot destination to visit. Alex Cornell's guide Is very detailed especially when covering:
<ul>
<li>The Best Times to Go</li>
<li>Sample Itineraries</li>
<li>Sights to See</li>
<li>Where to Stay</li>
</ul>


<h2>Alex Cornell's Iceland Travel Guide</h2>
In conclusion, I wish most travel guides were as detailed. The creator of this guide is Alex Cornell, a Designer at Facebook and an amazing photographer.
