Briefbox is a website that creates challenges and briefs for designers to attempt and build their skills.  One of their challenges, "Quick Fire: Plant care app", was a brief that I decided to take on. Below is my take on a Mobile App UI Design for a Plant Care App called Cac.tus.


<h2>Workflow</h2>
For my workflow in this project, I used several tools. In general, I'm flexible on what tools I choose to use. I'm always in favor of whichever tool will get the work the best is the right tool for the job. Here is a quick summary of my workflow:

<ul>
<li>Balsamq: Create Sitemap and Wireframes</li>
<li>Sketch: Build Screens</li>
<li>InvisionApp: Prototype build and Navigation</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sitemap and Wireframes</h2>
I started the Plant Care UI design by creating a Sitemap and Wireframes. I began by using the software Balasamq, which is a sketch style design app. The Sitemap was made to have a point of reference and create a loose guide of how the navigation would behave.

After the Sitemap was created, I moved on to the Wireframes. These were helpful in developing the look and rhythm of how each page would look.

<h2>Sketch: Building Screens</h2>
From the wireframes above I decided to pursue the last set from the bottom row. I thought this set had rhythm and the better design compared to the rest. For colors, I stuck with green as it generally symbolizes plants. I choose Cactus as a plant of choice.

<h2>Invision: Building the Prototype</h2>
Invision is great for building design prototypes. It integrates with both Sketch and Photoshop to easily allow transitioning your designs into prototypes. Invision is cloud base and if you're working with a team allows you to gather feedback from your designs. Using Invision, I was able to create hotspots in the screens I created in Sketch and link each page to each other. I have added the completed Mobile App UI Design below.

<h2>Summary:Mobile App UI Design</h2>
In conclusion, I had fun working on the Mobile App UI Design project. I'm looking to do more Mobile App UI design work and I think tools like Balsamq, Sketch, and Invision will help in the process. I think I would like to expand on this project in the future. Perhaps incorporating additional plants. I like the idea of starting off with a simple project and then leaving room to push it further in the future.
