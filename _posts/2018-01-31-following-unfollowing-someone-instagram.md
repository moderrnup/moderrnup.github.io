I happened upon Jade Darmawangsa (@jadedarmawangsa) vlog on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSPWnWuVALjpQ0s2RL46Wzw" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Youtube</a> concerning the dreaded follow than unfollow trend. If you're new to this social media trend, I think it primarily started on Instagram. Everyone wants to have tons of followers because it's seen as a status symbol. I have also heard this tactic now being used on other Social Media platforms, namely Youtube & Twitter. I suggest giving her video a watch why you should stop Following then Unfollowing someone on Instagram:

<h2>Why You Should Stop Following then Unfollowing Someone on Instagram</h2>
I have listed some of the reasons you should stop this trend now:

<ul>
<li>One: Following then Unfollowing Someone on Instagram is rude.</li>
<li>Two: You're not getting meaningful followers</li> 
<li>Three: Everyone now has an app that tracks who Follows than Unfollows you</li> 
</ul>

Personally, when I find out someone has followed me and then unfollowed me, I look at that person in a negative light. Following then Unfollowing Someone on Instagram was a lot easier to get away with before Unfollower apps were made available. 


<h2>Collaborating as a Solution</h2>
One of the things Jade Darmawangsa recommends is collaborating with fellow Instagrammers. This means reaching out to someone you want to collaborate with on Instagram by direct messaging them. There will be a percentage that won't respond to your DM. However, the ones that do will be great to engage with. 

<h2>Summary</h2>
Following then Unfollowing Someone on Instagram is a bit like "Ghosting" in dating. People that do it, don't like to admit they do it because they know it's bad. Everyone knows it's rude but people still do it because it's easy. After all, they are just after followers and they use this tactic as an easy solution.
