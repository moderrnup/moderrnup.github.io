<h2>Background</h2>
There have been rumors that Canon plans to release their first Full Frame Mirrorless Camera. This new camera would potentially be a replacement for the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009B0MZ8U/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B009B0MZ8U&linkCode=as2&tag=moderrnwebsit-20&linkId=38b0bca65f9336fdb4d53e9b80cb12aa">Canon 6D</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=moderrnwebsit-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B009B0MZ8U" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> product line of cameras. Launching Canon’s First Full-Frame Mirrorless Camera should address a few areas such as:
<ul>
<li>Strenghs &amp; Weaknesses of the Product</li>
<li>Competitors</li>
<li>Launch Strategy</li>
</ul>

<h2>LAUNCHING CANON’S FIRST FULL FRAME MIRRORLESS CAMERA</h2>
Canon's current M line of cameras is their mirrorless product line. The recently released <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LXTX4HC/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01LXTX4HC&linkCode=as2&tag=moderrnwebsit-20&linkId=3bb8995c5dace7d98c3116c3c5d7ceda">Canon M5</a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=moderrnwebsit-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B01LXTX4HC" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> was released in November of 2016 and is closer in specs to a professional camera. However, it uses an APS-C sensor and not a full frame sensor. Canon's First Professional Mirrorless Camera should be an answer to the Sony lineup of full-frame mirrorless products. Sony's Alpha line of cameras targets photographers who want a DSLR capable camera in a compact size. 

<h2>Strengths of Mirrorless Cameras</h2>
The strengths of mirrorless cameras are that they are light and compact. This makes traveling with your camera less of a burden. If you're traveling you can also pack more items. While mirrorless cameras are lighter, the battery life in these cameras is often shorter. Many batteries of mirrorless cameras expire in 400 shots compared to an average of 1000 on a DSLR. 

<h2>Competitors</h2>
Canon's first full-frame mirrorless camera would be competing with Sony and Leicas group of full-frame mirrorless cameras. The Sony Alpha line is priced between 1400 - 3000. Because of the affordability and the features that are offered, Sony is a major player in this space. Right now many users of Sony Alpha line are limited in terms of lenses they can use on the Sony Alpha line. Because there are not enough full frame lenses to go around, many Sony Alpha users resort to using full frame Canon lenses. They can do this with use of lens adapter. Canon could market their full-frame mirrorless camera as a camera that doesn't require adapters to use. As a result, this would appeal to Sony users as they currently using lenses for the Canon system.  


<h2>Product Launch:</h2>
I'll be looking at the following areas for the Full Frame's Mirrorless Cameras Launch:
<ul>
<li>Pre-launch </li>
<li>Launch</li>
<li>Post-Launch</li>
</ul>

<h4>Pre-launch:</h4>

Pre-launch should consist of getting the product in the hands of users
<ul>
<li> Inviting professional photographers, bloggers, vloggers, and journalist to demo the camera.</li>
<li>Spreading the details of the camera through Canon's Social Media: Facebook Groups, Instagram, Reddit, Twitter.</li>
<li>Build an email list through a pre-order signup page, informational newsletter, and metrics on Social Media.</li>
<li> Engage with sales department to demo the new product to them.</li>
<li> schedule a slow launch through an invite-only system with select customers.</li>
<li> Record feedback from beta users </li>
<li> Offer incentives for customers that refer their friends to the product </li>
</ul>

<h4>Launch: </h4>

After Pre-Launch and product is available for general release, product demos can then be conducted. In addition, media interviews can be conducted for the new product. Display product at photography and tech events. Press releases can then be generated.  

<h4>Post-Launch: </h4>

For post-launch, I would schedule interviews with professional photographers, videographers, and other potential users. Since these are the primary users of the product they can provide testimonials of the camera. Most of all we can use the feedback we received for future releases to address any potential issues.

<h2>Analysis of metrics</h2>
Finally, we can create testimonials based on demos & feedback from users. So we can analyze how well the product was received and by customers. Using the feedback from customers and data analysis we can determine if the new product is a success. Therefore we can decide if we have introduced a worthy full-frame competitor to the Sony Alpha product lines.
