Last October I decided to travel to Yosemite for the first time. Yosemite had been on my travel bucket list for some time now. It's a national park that is extremely popular and has some of the best views I have seen. I had no idea how gigantic and massive Yosemite is. I gathered a list of the Top 3 Spots to Visit in Yosemite for new visitors.

<h2>Glacier Point</h2>
I would point new visitors to start their Yosemite trip to <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/glacierpoint.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Glacier Point</a>. The <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/glacierpoint.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Glacier Point</a> overlook sits upon the highest peak of Yosemite. From the overlook, you can see amazing views of Yosemite Valley, Half Dome, and Yosemite Falls. Also, the road leading to Glacier Point is among one of the most scenic roads I have driven upon. 

<h2>Yosemite Valley</h2>
<a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/yv.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Yosemite Valley</a> is the next spot I'd recommend and fortunately, it's not hard to miss. You'll notice the lines of cars and tour buses along the main road, each parking to take in the Valley's surrounding. <a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/yv.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Yosemite Valley</a> is what most people think of about Yosemite. You probably have seen sites like Bridal falls and Half Dome on people's Instagram. 

<h2>Tioga Pass Road</h2>
<a href="https://www.nps.gov/yose/planyourvisit/tm.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Tioga Pass Road</a> is the perfect spot in Yosemite to get away from the touristy crowded areas. This road is a long drive but you do have various stops along the way. From alpine lakes, granite peaks, and vast meadows. Among some of the areas to check out are Olmsted Point and the gorgeous Tenaya Lake. 

<h2>Top 3 Spots to Visit in Yosemite: Conclusion</h2>
In summary, Yosemite is a massive majestic park. I would recommend finding lodging as close to possible near the park. You can stay at a campsite or find lodgings nearby but make sure to reserve in advance. You will never run out of sites to check out in the park. Pack a good camera, some coffee, and enjoy a great time in Yosemite.
