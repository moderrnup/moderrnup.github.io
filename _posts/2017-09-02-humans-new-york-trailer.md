<h2>Humans of New York Series</h2>
<div id="js_i5" class="_5pbx userContent" data-ft="{&quot;tn&quot;:&quot;K&quot;}">

A new TV series will be coming to the Facebook's Watch platform. The TV series is inspired based upon Brandon Stanton's "Humans of New York". During creation of Stanton's Humans of New York he filmed over 1,200 interviews with residents & visitors of New York. With assistance from cinematographer Michael Crommett, the series features quotes and short stories from a variety of New York residents. I'm looking forward to seeing the photo series translated into the video medium.
