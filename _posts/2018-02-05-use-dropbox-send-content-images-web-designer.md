During the beginning of a web design project you will need to send content and images to your web designer. To limit any delays in completing a website it's best to send these files at the beginning of the website creation. There are many ways to send content to your web designer such as Email, Google Drive. One useful way I have found is to use <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/?landing=dbv2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> to send content and images to your Web Designer. 


<h2>Use Dropbox to Send Content and Images to Your Web Designer</h2>
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/?landing=dbv2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> is a great tool in providing contents to send images to your Web Developer. A Dropbox Basic account is free and includes 2 GB of space. This should be more than enough for uploading text and photo files for your Web Developer to use. 

<h2>Organize Content Based On Website Planning</h2>
Normally you will have a consultation with your web designer. During this consultation for the planning of your website you will probably decide on the page structure of your website. For instance, page structure for a Copy Writer's website may look something like this:

<ul>
<li>About</li>
<li>Contact</li>
<li>Home</li>
<li>Projects</li>
</ul>

Once you have an idea of the page structure of the website, you can organize and name your photos. Many websites follow a pattern of using a photo of yourself and possibly an optional background photo. I think the best way is to name each photo with the page title in mind. For example:

<b>About Page</b>
<ul>
<li>About_ProfilePhoto.jpg</li>
<li>About_BackgroundPhoto.jpg</li>
</ul>

<b>Contact Page</b>
<ul>
<li>Contact_Photo.jpg</li>
</ul>

<b>Home Page</b>
<ul>
<li>Homepage_Photo.jpg</li>
<li>Homepage_BackgroundPhoto.jpg</li>
</ul>

<b>Project Page</b>
<ul>
<li>ABCCompany_Project_Photo.jpg</li>
<li>ABCCompany_Project_AdditionalPhoto</li>
</ul>

<h2>Organizing Page Content</h2>
Similar to how we organize the photos above, we can use a similar strategy for the web site pages. It's best to keep the photos and page content separate for faster implementation into the website. A great tool to use is Microsoft Word and create separate document pages for each Web Page:

<b>About.doc</b>
<ul>
<li>Details About Yourself</li>
<li>Background</li>
</ul>

<b>Contact.doc</b>
<ul>
<li>Contact Details</li>
<li>Email Details</li>
<li>Phone Details</li>
<li>Optional: Address Information for Stores, Services</li>
</ul>

<b>HomePage.doc</b>
<ul>
<li>Homepage Details</li>
</ul>

<b>Project.doc</b>
<ul>
<li>Description of Each Project</li>
</ul>

<h2>Uploading to DropBox</h2>
You can use the following steps to upload to DropBox
<ul>
<b><li>Sign in to the Dropbox website.</li>
<li>Create a Folder Name for Your Project, example: WebsiteContent</li>
<li>Click the Upload button at the top of the window.</li>
<li>A window will appear. Click the Choose File button and then select the file on your computer that you'd like to add to your Dropbox.</li>
<li>Choose as many files as you like, and then click the Start Upload button.</li></b>
</ul>

After the upload has been completed, you can then share the Folder Name with your Web Designer.

<h2>Summary</h2>
In conclusion, this is just a sample of how to use <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/?landing=dbv2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> to send content to your Web Designer. The naming convention will change depending on the type of website you want. The content organization of an e-commerce website may look drastically different. A service type website may include a Services page instead of a Projects page. I hopefully the above gives you insight on how to use dropbox to send content and images to your Web Designer. <a href="https://www.moderrn.com/work-with-me/">Connect with me</a> to get started on building your website.
