I began using Trello for Project management and productivity tool this January. Trello is a visual project management and collaboration app that is used by many. As I discussed in <a href="https://www.moderrn.com/2018/02/12/spend-time-freelancer/">What I Spend the Most Time on as a Freelancer</a>, Trello has been an amazing tool for organizing my projects and blog schedule.  

Below is a Sample of a Trello Boards:

<h2>Competitors:</h2>
Some noteworthy competitors to Trello include:
<ul>
<li>Asana</li>
<li>Basecamp</li>
<li>Airtable</li>
</ul>

At this time, one disadvantage that Trello has in comparison to its competitors is a time tracking feature. However, there are a number of third-party extensions that are available to enable time tracking in Trello. Many of the apps above have a native time tracking as part of their software.  

<h2>Summary: Using Trello for Project Management</h2>
In conclusion, using Trello for Project Management is a great tool. I think that Trello can work for anyone whether you use it to keep track of your side projects or your companies workflow. I think Trello's main strength is the app's ease of use and visual design. The interface is simple and easy to look at. People have used Trello for job searches, goal tracking, and even holiday planning. Overall, I find Trello to be a great tool to organize and track your projects.
