I am a huge fan of cars and car shows. Throughout the year, there are several car shows that are held throughout the country and also internationally. As a Bay Area local I am always excited when the San Francisco Auto Show comes to town. The 2017 San Francisco Auto Show allows attendees to browse over 100 cars & SUVs from over 30 different manufacturers. Attendees can browse the insides and outsides of the new vehicles and explore many of the new features. 

<h2>Price of The 2017 San Francisco Auto Show</h2>
Ticket prices to the San Francisco Auto Show cost $10 for that particular day. This ticket will get you access to most of the cars on display in the exhibit. Typically, the San Francisco Auto Show is scheduled towards the last week of November around the Thanksgiving Holiday. This year, the event was held from November 18th - 26th at the San Francisco Moscone Center. On average, the hours for the show are between 10:00 a.m. – 9:00 p.m.   


<h2>What You Get</h2>
With your ticket to the San Francisco Auto Show, you gain access to several vehicles from popular car manufacturers. These manufacturers include Acura, Audi, BMW, Ford, Land Rover, Honda, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota and many more. Several of these manufacturers also hold test drives for their new cars. I signed up for a test drive for Land Rover fairly easily on the day I attended the show. During the test drives, attendees can function as the driver or opt to be the passenger during the duration of the drive. 

<h2>What You Won’t Get</h2>
Some things that you won't get at the San Francisco Auto Show are somewhat positive. For instance, when people tend to think of car shows they tend to think of pushy car salesmen who will do anything to get you to buy a car. Luckily this isn't the case with these types of auto shows. If anything auto shows such as these are more marketing and informational related. Another negative is that some of the exotic car models tend to be off-limits to attendees. For example, at Porsche's exhibit access was unavailable to their car lineup. 

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
In conclusion, the San Francisco Auto Show is an amazing event to attend. In addition to the available cars and test drives, manufacturers hold games and prizes for attendees to win. Whether you are planning on buying a car now or in the future, your time will be well spent. I look forward to attending next years San Francisco Auto Show.
