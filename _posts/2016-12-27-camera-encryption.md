<h4>A Need for Encryption in Cameras</h4>

PetaPixel recently wrote an article about Encryption in Cameras. Encryption in Cameras would really be useful. Security is a major concern when traveling with a camera. Camera encryption would resolved many of the concerns that happen when traveling with expensive and sensitive equipment. All camera brands appear to be slow when it comes to camera encryption and security. Having an option for a passcode or fingerprint scanner available to secure the camera. As someone who has lost a camera while traveling the need to have this type of protection is important. Having the ability to use the same technology that is used to track your smartphone would be a useful for camera equipment.

The good news is camera companies appear to be aware of this as an issue. Companies such as Nikon, Fujifilm, and Olympus are aware of this issue and are researching the issue further.
