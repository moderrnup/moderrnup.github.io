<h2>Taking Great Vacation Photos On Holiday</h2>
Shivani Vora of the New York Times recently wrote an article on how to taking great vacation photos. Suggestions included in the article recommended to take photos at sunrise and sunset. Sunrise and sunset shots have less crowds and provide less stress when trying to get the perfect shot. Strangers walking into your line of site are less of a concern while taking a great vacation photos. 

<h2>Which Camera to Bring?</h2>
I also agree that you don't need a fancy camera to take great vacation photos. However, I also recommend not relying solely on using the camera on your mobile phone. I looked back recently at some of the photos I took of my first trip to Vancouver. I used a small DSLR, a Nikon D50, for me trip to Vancouver. For photos that were taken in 2011, they still hold up pretty well compared to my old IPhone. A mobile phone is convenient because it is a camera that you carry all the time. 

<h2>Compact Solution</h2>

If you're traveling to a unique destination and want to create lasting memories without carry a DSLR several options exist. My recomendations are the Sony RX100 line of cameras. A camera such as the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MCRBY4X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01MCRBY4X&linkCode=as2&tag=moderrnwebsit-20&linkId=95f42f5f2de3feb89281220712378a61">Sony RX100 V </a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=moderrnwebsit-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B01MCRBY4X" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> is compact and fits in your pocket. You could also choose a mirrorless camera. Mirrorless cameras are smaller and not as and bulky as DSLRS. Above all else, have fun while you're on vacation.
