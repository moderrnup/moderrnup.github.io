<h2>The Best Place to Stay in Sydney Australia</h2>

I traveled to Sydney Australia two years ago and it became one of my favorite destinations. Due to this being my first visit to Sydney, I stayed in the Central Business District area of Sydney Austrailia.  The best place to stay in Sydney Australia, in my opinion, would be in the neighbor called the Rocks. When I heard about the fantastic architecture in the Rocks, I grabbed my camera and proceeded to explore the neighborhood.

Because of "the Rock's location to the main attractions, it makes the area the perfect spot for the first time visitor to Sydney. Since "the Rocks" is in close proximity to these attractions, you can walk to the Opera House, Downtown, and even catch a ferry at the Sydney Harbor. In addition to main attractions, there are also shops, cafes, and restaurants close by in the neighborhood.  


<h2>Runner Up: Bondi Beach</h2>

I'm a big fan of being close to the ocean and Bondi Beach is the perfect neighborhood. One of the reasons Bondi is a great location is that the area has fewer crowds than the busier locations in Sydney such as around the Opera House and the Central Business District. While Sydney Austraila is known for the Opera House, Koalas, and Kangaroos, it is also known for its amazing beaches. 


<h2>Summary: The Best Place to Stay in Sydney Australia</h2>
In conclusion, I think you will be pleased with any neighborhood you select in Sydney Australia. After you travel to a new place you develop an orientation on where things are and the best way to experience the city. Because I love amazing architecture, the Rocks is a neighborhood that I found myself visiting often when I was in Sydney. Similar to my post about the <a href="https://www.moderrn.com/2018/01/26/skyline-collection-in-roppongi-tokyo-japan/">Skyline Gallery</a> in Roppongi in Japan, I will be doing more travel features in the future.
