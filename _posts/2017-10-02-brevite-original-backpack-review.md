<h4>Brevite Original Backpack</h4>
I am always on the lookout for items that make my hobbies easier. In the case of photography and shooting on the go, I'm drawn to backpacks that have a side pocket in which I can access my camera quickly. The Brevite Original backpack is one of the few backpacks that feature a side pocket and make run and gun shooting easy for the photographer.

The <a href="https://brevite.co/product/modern-student-camera-bag/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brevite Original</a> backpack costs between $100 - $145. The $145 version includes a protective insert that adds cushioning and protection to your camera and lenses. The interior of the insert allows you to customize the layout to best fit your preferences. If you opt to not include the protective insert the backpack will cost $100.

The dimensions of the backpack are 18in(L) x 13in(W) x 6in(H). Inside the backpack there are several pockets and dividers such as a laptop divider that will hold a 15inch sized laptop. Some of the features of Brevite's Original backpack include:

 	<li>Sternum strap and hip belt with memory card pockets.</li>
 	<li>Sunglasses loop on shoulder strap</li>
 	<li>Sternum strap and hip belt with memory card pockets</li>
 	<li>Side tripod holder</li>
 	<li>Water bottle holder</li>
 	<li>Bottom tripod holder</li>
 	<li>Built in Raincover</li>
 	<li>600D Nylon</li>
 	<li>YKK Zippers</li>

I have been using the <a href="https://brevite.co/product/modern-student-camera-bag/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brevite Original</a> backpack for three months as my daily backpack and I enjoy it's flexibility. Although I think the Manfrotto backpacks have slightly better materials and quality, I would highly recommend the <a href="https://brevite.co/product/modern-student-camera-bag/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brevite Original</a> as a backpack to carry your photo gear & access it quickly on the go.
