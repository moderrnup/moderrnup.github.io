I visited the Bay Model in Sausalito, California last Friday. The Bay Model is a hydraulic scale model of the San Francisco Bay and Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta System. You can see the Bay Model at the Bay Model Visitor Center at 2100 Bridgeway Blvd. in Sausalito, California. The Bay Model was constructed in 1957 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for scientific purposes.

The size of the model is approximately 320 feet long in the north-south direction. It is 400 feet long in the east-west direction. Access to the model is free and open to the public. Towards the end of the bay model you can see a hallway exhibit with photos and newspaper clippings dedicated to the history of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

Outside of the Bay Model museum there are amazing views of the ocean of Sausalito as well as bike paths to enjoy the outdoor areas.
