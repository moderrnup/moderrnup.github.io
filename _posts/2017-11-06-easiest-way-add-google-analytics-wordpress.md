<h2>THE EASIEST WAY TO ADD GOOGLE ANALYTICS TO WORDPRESS</h2>  
Google Analytics is one of the most insightful statistical software in the field. In addition to being free of charge, Google Analytics offers fantastic features. Most noteworthy is that it allows you to segment your visitors by location, referral sources, their page preference. The easiest way to add Google Analytics to Wordpress is through the use of a plugin called MonsterInsights. The benefits of using a plugin for Google Analytics is that it stores information in an easily accessible place. That way if you wanted to change the theme of your Wordpress site in the future, you can retain your Google Analytics setup data. 

<h2>Why Your Site Needs Analytics</h2>
Gathering statistics for your website are important to have as a market strategy. Primarily because statistics help in determining what type of content works well for your site. They can also assist in helping what doesn't work for your audience. Therefore, you can spend your time on what matters on your site and less time on what doesn't.


<h2>Step 1: Sign Up for a Google Analytics</h2>
Sign up for a Google Analytics account if you do not have one. 
<ul>
<li>Navigate to the <a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Google Analytics Website</a></li>

</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
In Conclusion, Google Analytics is a powerful tool. I feel that Google Analytics can help you deliver better content in the future. One example would be seeing where what social media site delivers the most traffic. Perhaps Facebook delivers the most traffic to your site, while Twitter lags behind. You can work on different strategies the following month to improve traffic coming from Twitter. Or if a blog post generates the most views maybe turning that popular post into a video would gather other audience sources. Overall having the data available to make different marketing decisions with your website is very useful in delivering content to your audience.
