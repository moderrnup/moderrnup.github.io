While researching on color choices used in branding, I came across the Instagram account: <a href="http://instagram.com/colorpalette.cinema" rel="no opener" target="_blank">colorpalette.cinema</a>. Color Palettes in Cinema highlights many different color schemes used in a film. Because I love film, as you might have guessed from some of my early <a href="https://www.moderrn.com/2017/02/14/photography-movies-you-need-to-watch/">articles</a>, I decided to write about <a href="http://instagram.com/colorpalette.cinema" rel="no opener" target="_blank">colorpalette.cinema</a>. It seems like design and moviemaking have a lot of similarities to each other, in that they take various mediums to communicate a message to the audience. In addition, cinema combines typography, imagery, sound, and color to produce a unique work of art. 

<h2>Color Palettes in Cinema</h2>
The Instagram account, <a href="http://instagram.com/colorpalette.cinema" rel="no opener" target="_blank">colorpalette.cinema</a>, started as early as October of 2016. Along with investigating the color scheme, each post for the scene references the title of the film, director, cinematographer and production designer. One thing I noticed is that many of the color palettes were complementary with one another. Overall most of the color selections are harmonious with one another.

<h2>Summary</h2>
In conclusion, <a href="http://instagram.com/colorpalette.cinema" rel="noopener" target="_blank">colorpalette.cinema</a> mentions that, "Color can affect us psychologically, often without us being aware". Dark tones in some scenes tend to be reserved for moody scenes in contrast to energetic scenes having warmer colors. Therefore, adding colors such as soft grays and greens produce a calming effect in the below scene from "Call Me By Your Name":
