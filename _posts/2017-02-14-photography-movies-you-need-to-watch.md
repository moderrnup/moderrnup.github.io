<h2>The List of Photography Movies You Need to Watch</h2>
Movies & documentaries can inspire an audience. Since they combine visual and sound it can capture and display emotions more uniquely than any other medium. The photographer Benjamin Lee recently wrote a blog post on his five favorite photography related movies & documentaries. Among photography movies you need to watch from Benjamin's list are two films:  
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0359950/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">THE SECRET LIFE OF WALTER MITTY</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0758758/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">INTO THE WILD</a></li>
</ul>

These two films were centered around photographers. I plan to see the other movies referenced on the list.

<h2>City of God</h2>
One movie that I was hoping to see on the list was the film "City of God". Set in Rio de Janeiro, the movie tells a story of growing up in the favelas. Most of all it centers on a young man with dreams of becoming a photographer. The young man, Buscap√© (Nicked named Rocket), was based on a combination of Paulo Lins, the author of the book "Cidade de Deus", and a childhood friend of who dreamt of becoming a photographer.

Throughout the film, Rocket uses various cameras such as a Kodak Instamatic and Retina Reflex III. It's, however, the Nikon F camera that leads the character to his dream job as a photographer and a way out of the favelas. This I think is the beauty of the film. The Nikon F seems as some sort of mystical object in the movie. You see how the camera travels from one owner to another. As if by destiny it eventually lands in Rockets hands. He eventually uses it as an object in escaping the favelas. 

In conclusion, if you enjoy movies about photography I recommend watching "City of God".
