Current article from Ty Poland at Fstoppers discusses finding a comfort zone in photography. Comfort zones are helpful to practice photography and become familiar with your camera. I have at least two comfort zones that I go to in order to practice photography. I am hoping to find more. I think comfort zones should be quiet areas and areas without a lot of people. Once practice that I hope to implement in the coming new year is to photograph before dawn to open myself up to more areas to photograph.
